## Technologies Used
The website is built using the following technologies and languages:
- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap)
- JavaScript

## Code Explanation
### `translateContent(language)`
- This function facilitates language translation on the webpage, allowing users to switch between different languages.
- It utilizes a predefined set of translations stored in a JavaScript object to replace original text with translated equivalents.

### `fetchJobs()`
- This function retrieves job listings from a hypothetical API endpoint (`https://api.example.com/jobs?location=Japan`) and dynamically updates the webpage to display the fetched data.
- It generates HTML elements dynamically to present job titles and their respective locations within the designated section of the webpage.

### `setupBookmark()`
- This function enhances user experience by adding bookmarking functionality to job listings.
- It toggles the appearance of bookmark icons and updates button text to reflect whether a job listing has been saved or removed.

### `initMap()`
- This function initializes a Google Map with a zoom level of 8 and centers it around Tokyo coordinates (latitude: 35.6895, longitude: 139.6917).
- Although defined, this function does not seem to be utilized in the provided code.

### `populateJobListings(searchTerm)`
- Similar to `fetchJobs()`, this function retrieves job listings from the API endpoint based on a provided search term.
- It updates the job listings section to display only those jobs that match the user's search criteria.
(As my exam is there so I created this project in hurry that's why I did't add full functional features.)
